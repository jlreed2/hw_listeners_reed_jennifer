##Resources
* From Adv Web 1:
    * I utilized some notes from Adv Web 1 and referenced the book for that class 'JavaScript A Beginner's Guide' by John Pollock for the form and an additional resource to understand event listeners
    
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21491119/sending-form-text-input-to-console-log-for-testing)
    * I referenced this for help understanding how to log different elements to the console (seeing someone else's method somehow made it finally click)

* [Cat Picture](http://www.businessinsider.com/image/4f3433986bb3f7b67a00003c/cute-cat.jpg)
    * This is where I got the cat picture
 
* I also rewatched the event listeners lecture and scoured over the notes at least a hundred

##Comments
* Conceptually I understood event listeners after reading through the handout. Watching the lecture helped as well. But when it came time to put it all into practice, I understood what I was to be doing, but had a very hard time actually executing it initially. Once I got the form to work, the custom branch seemed almost easy. Almost. 

* I'm almost positive there is a simplified way to code logging each input on the form to the console, but I couldn't find one that worked (by my own trial and error). If you could point me in a better direction for that, I'd appreciate it.
